# BharatIntern Projects
This repository contains the projects completed during my internship. The projects focused on data analysis and machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems.

Project 1: Titanic Survival Classification

Overview

The Titanic Survival Classification project aimed to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic would survive or not, based on various attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. This is a classic machine learning problem often used for educational purposes.
